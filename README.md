My first Front-End Project using HTML only
That's include doing class with:
-The starting project code
-Tags: 
<head> - the digital document of the site with info's
<body> - the construction of lines on site
<h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> - tittle
<span> <p> - lines
<div> - organization maybe CSS
<table> - increase a table info
<form> - a simple form base
<input> - set some code like "button" example
<img> - give a image for the page and alt="" accompliment
<a> - take a connection using base gerally href=""(for search the direct link on name), that you can use a variable name.
    

    
With all of that, we made the base of a website using front-end
